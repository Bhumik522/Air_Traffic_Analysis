# Air_Traffic_Analysis

Introduction:
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of monthly passenger traffic data in the aviation sector. The dataset includes the number of passengers per month and is visualized to observe trends, seasonality, and traffic volume fluctuations. The objective of this analysis is to identify peak travel periods, low traffic intervals, and general patterns that can aid strategic planning for airport operations, airlines, and policymakers.
1. Data Overview:
The dataset contains information on monthly passenger counts.

Features included:
- Month: Indicates the time period (monthly granularity).
- Passenger Count: The number of passengers recorded in that month.

The dataset was loaded using the pandas library for data manipulation and initial exploration.
2. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
The data was imported from a CSV file using:
df = pd.read_csv("air_traffic_data.csv")

Preprocessing steps included:
- Checking for and handling missing values using df.isnull().sum().
- Ensuring proper data types for each column.
- No major anomalies or formatting issues were detected.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Basic insights were derived using:
- df.head() to preview the first few rows.
- df.info() and df.describe() for data type and statistical summaries.

A line plot was created using seaborn to visualize passenger trends over months.
4. Data Visualization
A time series line chart was developed to visualize passenger traffic across months:

sb.lineplot function is used to visualize the passenger count across the month.


- Additional formatting:
  - figsize=(20, 9)
  - Rotated x-tick labels for better readability.
  - Grid lines for visual support.

This helped highlight monthly variations in traffic volumes.
5. Key Observations
- Clear seasonality in air traffic data.
- Notable peak travel months.
- Lower traffic in specific months, possibly due to off-peak travel seasons.
- Visualization serves as a valuable tool for forecasting and capacity planning.
6. Recommendations for Future Analysis
- Year-wise breakdown (if multi-year data is available) to detect year-on-year trends.
- Time series forecasting using ARIMA or Prophet for demand prediction.
- Correlation with external factors such as weather, holidays, or fuel prices.
- Identify anomalies such as COVID-affected months if applicable.
Conclusion:
This initial exploration and visualization of air traffic data provide strong insights into passenger behavior across months. A deeper dive into seasonal patterns and extended features could further enhance forecasting accuracy and operational efficiency. The use of a dark purple color theme ensures visual clarity and professional aesthetics in the presentation.
